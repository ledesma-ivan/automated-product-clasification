Automated product categorization for e-commerce 
Creating relevant tags and categories on products allow e-commerce companies and super apps and marketplacesto automatically categorize products whether those are new products uploaded by a user or seller products that need large-scale automated categorization. Automation on this subject not only saves time and manual effort but creates a taxonomy system that improves the process of a customer finding what they are looking for, improving their conversion metrics, and activating frictionless and engaging shopping experiences. In this project you will apply natural language processing to create a multi-label system able to classify e-commerce products automatically.
